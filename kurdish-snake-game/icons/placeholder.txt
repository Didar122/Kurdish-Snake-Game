To complete the icon setup:

1. Create the following PNG icons for iOS:
- icon-152.png (152x152 pixels)
- icon-167.png (167x167 pixels)
- icon-180.png (180x180 pixels)

Design recommendations:
- Use a simple, recognizable snake design
- Make sure the icon looks good on dark and light backgrounds
- Add a subtle shadow or glow effect to make it stand out
- Use the same green colors as your game theme
- Make sure the icon has some padding (about 10-15% from edges)

Place all icon files in this directory.
